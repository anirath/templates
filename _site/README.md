# About #
This is a collection of projects, and their repositories, containing various templates created by [Anirath][1].
Some of them are created from the ground up, and others started by being forked from existing repositories.
All of them are available publically, and anyone may use them as desired (*abiding by each template's license, of course*)
or feel free to fork them. But, contributions by other developers are not welcome for the original projects.

If you have any questions about [Anirath's Templates][2], a specific template, or anything related feel free
to [contact][3] the developer, checkout the [Templates Documentation][4], or you can view each project's own
documentation (*usually found in a subdirectory titled 'docs' in the project root*).

# Download #
You can download all of the templates in archive from this page, or at the [releases page][5]. If you would
like to acquire a particular template then visit that template's project repository and either clone or fork
it. You can find a list of templates below.
